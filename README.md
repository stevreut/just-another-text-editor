# Just Another Social Network

An extremely minimal text editor whose primary purpose is to demonstrate use of **npm idb** (an npm package encapsulating IndexedDB) and [**PWA**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)

## Description

This model text editor really only enables the kind of text manipulation that is typically already available in the simplest possible text editor (e.g. Notepad, etc.) or in a typical HTML textarea field.  It has no direct access to the client's file system and can save and retrieve only a single document from a client-based IndexedDB database.

The **real** purpose of this application is simply to enable demonstration of the ability to very simple [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) and to make use of [npm idb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) for purposes of storing and retrieving data.

As is expected of a PWA, the application code is segregated into distinct *client* and *server* sections, each of those named as such and each having its own npm environment.

## Installation

*(Note: These are installation instructions from a developer's point of view.  Inasmuch as this is a deployed web application, there is no installation for end users beyond accessing the [Heroku site URL for this app](https://limitless-taiga-69389-73b7aa8088f4.herokuapp.com/).)*

### Developer installation instructions:

1. Install Node.jsÂ® if it is not already installed.    ([Node downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
2. from the [just-another-text-editor repository of GitHub](https://github.com/stevreut/just-another-text-editor):
    - select the green "**<> Code**" button
    - select the "**Download ZIP**" button from the resulting pop-up dialog
3. Placed the resulting `just-another-text-editor-main.zip` file in the location of your choice.
4. Unpack the `just-another-text-editor-main.zip` file, which should resulting in a folder/directory with name `just-another-text-editor-main`:
    - on Mac: double-click
    - on Windows: right-click and [follow these instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc)
5. Using bash, Mac terminal, or equivalent utility:
    - `cd` to the resulting `just-another-text-editor-main` directory
    - `npm install`
6. Again using bash, Mac terminal, or equivalent:
    - `npm run install`
7. To start the server locally:
    - `npm run start:dev`  *or*  `npm run start` 

## Usage

### End user

  - Access the [Heroku-deployed site](https://limitless-taiga-69389-73b7aa8088f4.herokuapp.com/)

### Developer/tester

  - Access the local server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  (noting, however, that the port *might* not be 3000 and the local server console logging should be checked to verify whether 3000 or some other port is in use)
