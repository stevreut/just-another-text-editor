various package.json files (done?)


client/src/js/database.js - many changes - essentially blank in "before" version


client/src/js/install.js - differs only in added comments - but worth reviewing - literally boiler-plate - just swap it over

client/src-sw.js - differs considerably - essentially blank before


webpack.config.js - differs considerably - (see note below)

server/.gitignore - identical - HOWEVER, makes me wonder if I should add a few things to mine (?).  Also, apparently there are at least two distinct .gitignore files - and presumably three (root, client(?), server)




Per DE : "most" of webpack.config... can be ported (with modifications to be relevant)
